Welcome!
This is the code accompanying the book "Runtime Verification: A Hands-On Approach in Java". 

As explained in Chapter 3 of the text, projects correspond to the book exercises. 
Simply import the code into your favourite IDE, read the book, and start coding away :) 

The solutions folders offer you guidance where you get stuck, and come in handy if you have skipped any chapters which are a prerequisite for later ones.

Hope you find this useful. 
If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate to get in touch with us!
